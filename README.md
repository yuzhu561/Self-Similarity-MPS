# Self-Similarity-MPS
This study discusses the existence of the self-similarity of the pore structure in rock samples. Then the self-similarity phenomenon is used to improve the resolution of the porous medium.
Procedures for running the code:
1. add the seg_path that defines the folder where the initial segmented image is stored in the __main__
2. add the save_recon_path that defines the folder where the reconstructed high-resolution image is saved in the __main__
